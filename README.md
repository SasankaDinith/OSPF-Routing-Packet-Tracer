<h1>🚀 Hands-on Networking: Configured NAT Protocol in Cisco Packet Tracer</h1>

<p>I'm excited to share that I successfully configured the Network Address Translation (NAT) protocol using Cisco Packet Tracer! 💻📡</p>

<p>This project allowed me to:</p>
<ul>
  <p>🔹 Translate private IP addresses to public IPs for internet access</p>
  <p>🔹 Implement Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and PAT (Port Address Translation)</p>
  <p>🔹 Understand how NAT enhances network security and IP address conservation</p>
</ul>

<h2>📝 Project Overview:</h2>
<p>This project involves the implementation of NAT (Network Address Translation) using Cisco Packet Tracer. It includes two internal networks and an additional ISP router setup. Initially, the internal networks could communicate with each other but not with the ISP network, as it uses public IP addresses while the internal networks use private IP addresses.</p>

<p>After configuring the NAT protocol on Router 2, the internal hosts were able to access the ISP network. This translation from private to public IP addresses allowed proper communication across networks, simulating a real-world internet access scenario.</p>

<h2>✅ Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <p>• Two internal networks</p>
  <p>• One ISP router</p>
  <p>• NAT configuration on Router 2</p>
  <p>• Enabled communication from private to public network</p>
</ul>

<h2>🛠 Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <p>🔧 Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.x recommended)</p>
   <p>🌐 Networking protocols: NAT, Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, PAT</p>
   <p>📁 File format: .pkt (Cisco Packet Tracer project file)</p>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 How to Run</h2>
<ol>
   <p>1. Download and install <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer">Cisco Packet Tracer</a></li>
 <p>2. Clone or download this repository</li>
   <p>3. Open the <code>.pkt</code> file using Cisco Packet Tracer</li>
   <p>4. Explore router configurations and test connectivity using simulation mode</li>
</ol>

<h2>📌 Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <p>✅ Basic understanding of IP addressing (private vs. public)</p>
   <p>✅ Familiarity with Cisco CLI (Command Line Interface)</p>
   <p>✅ Cisco Packet Tracer installed </p>
</ul>

<h2>📈 Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
   <p>✔️ Add DHCP server to assign dynamic IPs to clients</p>
  <p>✔️ Extend with Access Control Lists (ACLs) for security</p>
  <p>✔️ Visual diagram for better understanding of the topology</p>
</ul>
